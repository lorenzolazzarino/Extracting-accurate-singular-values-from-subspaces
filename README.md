Supplementary Materials of "Matrix Perturbation Analysis of Methods for Extracting Singular Values from Approximate Singular Subspaces" by  Lorenzo Lazzarino, Hussam Al Daas, Yuji Nakatsukasa

The repository contains:

### LANbound.m
Type: MatLab code 

Contents: MatLab function; It computes a bound on the accuracy in extracting singular values, given approximations tV (and tU) to the leading singular subspaces, for one of the methods: Generalized Nystrom, HMT, Rayleigh-Ritz, or SVD. It is an implementation of the results of Section 5; </p>

### LANbound_script.m
Type: MatLab code </p>

Contents: MatLab script; It provides the code to replicate the experiments of Section 6. It requires LANbound.m to be run.
